Hi, I'm **Erling Devold** â€” a machine learning researcher and engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that learn from limited supervision.

Currently, I lead the development of a weakly supervised learning approach for analyzing sonar data. 
I'm particularly interested in combining **representation learning**, **marine imaging**, and **creative AI**, including music + ML crossover work.

My background includes:
- ðŸŽ“ MSc in Computer Science â€“ Machine Learning specialization
- ðŸ”¬ Applied AI research at SINTEF
- ðŸŒŠ Work on broadband echosounders, catch reports, and acoustic modeling
- ðŸŽ¼ Side interest in music systems and signal transformation

I believe in open science, reproducible ML workflows, and exploring the frontier between the natural and computational world.
